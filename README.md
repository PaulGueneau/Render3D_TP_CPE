# Render3D_TP_CPE
Some work on 3D-Rendering done during practical work at school based on pre-written code.

To compile and execute from the CMakeLists.txt: 

cd project
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
./build/pgm

- On the using of IDE (QtCreator, etc).
The executing folder must be in project/ hence the folder data/ must be accessible.
